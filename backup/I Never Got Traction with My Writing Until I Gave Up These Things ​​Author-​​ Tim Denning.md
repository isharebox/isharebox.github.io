​​Title:​​ I Never Got Traction with My Writing Until I Gave Up These Things
​​Author:​​ Tim Denning
​​Theme:​​ Overcoming obstacles in writing by abandoning counterproductive habits.
Key Points and Examples:
1. ​​Asking Gatekeepers for Permission​​

    ​​Problem:​​ Gatekeepers (e.g., publication owners, platform staff) are often unqualified or inconsistent.
    ​​Solution:​​ Write on "permissionless" platforms (e.g., social media).
    ​​Example:​​ The author researched gatekeepers’ LinkedIn profiles and found many lacked credibility (e.g., no audience, frequent job changes).

2. ​​Using Shortcuts (Engagement Pods, Bot Comments)​​

    ​​Problem:​​ Artificial engagement (e.g., trading likes, buying bots) doesn’t build genuine audiences.
    ​​Solution:​​ Focus on ​​digital writing skills​​:
        Strong headlines, concise storytelling, research-backed points.
    ​​Example:​​ The author admits trying shortcuts but found real success only after prioritizing quality.

3. ​​Writing on Only One Platform​​

    ​​Problem:​​ Over-reliance on one platform risks bans or algorithm changes.
    ​​Solution:​​ Diversify platforms + build an ​​owned audience​​ (e.g., email list).
    ​​Example:​​ The author was banned from a platform for “misinformation” and realized the need to spread his work.

4. ​​Switching Platforms Frequently​​

    ​​Problem:​​ Chasing new platforms (e.g., Bluesky, Mastodon) wastes time.
    ​​Solution:​​ Stick to established platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, X) that have longevity.
    ​​Example:​​ The author mentions how startup platforms often fail, unlike LinkedIn/X.

5. ​​Comparing Progress to Other Writers​​

    ​​Problem:​​ Vanity metrics (likes, followers) create discouragement.
    ​​Solution:​​ Avoid comparison; many “successful” writers use ghostwriters or bots.
    ​​Example:​​ The author ignored others’ viral posts and focused on authenticity.

6. ​​Trying to Force Virality​​

    ​​Problem:​​ Virality is random and uncontrollable.
    ​​Solution:​​ Write consistently; virality may happen organically.
    ​​Example:​​ The author realized timing/headline tricks don’t guarantee virality.

7. ​​Avoiding External Feedback​​

    ​​Problem:​​ Writing in isolation leads to errors and unclear messaging.
    ​​Solution:​​ Collaborate with writing groups for edits and feedback.
    ​​Example:​​ The author improved after joining a feedback group that highlighted his blind spots.

8. ​​Chasing Lottery-Style Opportunities​​

    ​​Problem:​​ Rare payouts (e.g., $500/article) are unreliable.
    ​​Solution:​​ Build repeatable income streams (e.g., newsletters, paid subscriptions).
    ​​Example:​​ The author stopped chasing one-off payments and treated writing as a business.

9. ​​Obsessing Over Algorithms​​

    ​​Problem:​​ Algorithms are unpredictable and ever-changing.
    ​​Solution:​​ Focus on creating shareable, high-quality content.
    ​​Example:​​ The author notes that algorithms prioritize shareable content, not gimmicks.

Final Thought:

Success comes from abandoning gimmicks and focusing on ​​authenticity, skill-building, and audience ownership​​. Writing is a long-term game, not a lottery.
Examples from the Article:

    ​​Gatekeepers:​​ The author checked LinkedIn to expose gatekeepers’ lack of expertise.
    ​​Shortcuts:​​ Tried engagement pods but saw no real growth.
    ​​Platform Bans:​​ Shifted to multiple platforms after a “misinformation” ban.
    ​​Feedback Group:​​ Improved clarity by collaborating with other writers.
    ​​Lottery Mentality:​​ Realized $500/article opportunities were statistically unlikely.

Actionable Takeaways:

    Build an email list to own your audience.
    Learn digital writing skills (headlines, formatting).
    Write consistently across 2–3 established platforms.
    Ignore vanity metrics; focus on meaningful engagement.
    Treat writing as a business, not a hobby.
