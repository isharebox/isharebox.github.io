It\u2019s meant to be an easy to read and write syntax which converts easily to HTML (and now many other formats as well).\r\n\r\nMarkdown also varies in implementation from one parser to a next. This guide will attempt to clarify when features are universal or when they are specific to a certain parser.\r\nHTML Elements\r\n\r\nMarkdown is a superset of HTML, so any HTML file is valid Markdown.\r\n\r\n<!--This means we can use HTML elements in Markdown, such as the comment\r\nelement, and they won't be affected by a markdown parser. However, if you\r\ncreate an HTML element in your markdown file, you cannot use markdown syntax\r\nwithin that element's contents.-->\r\n\r\nHeadings\r\n\r\nYou can create HTML elements <h1> through <h6> easily by prepending the text you want to be in that element by a number of hashes (#).\r\n\r\n# This is an <h1>\r\n## This is an <h2>\r\n### This is an <h3>\r\n#### This is an <h4>\r\n##### This is an <h5>\r\n###### This is an <h6>\r\n\r\nMarkdown also provides us with two alternative ways of indicating h1 and h2.\r\n\r\nThis is an h1\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is an h2\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nSimple text styles\r\n\r\nText can be easily styled as italic or bold using markdown.\r\n\r\n*This text is in italics.*\r\n_And so is this text._\r\n\r\n**This text is in bold.**\r\n__And so is this text.__\r\n\r\n***This text is in both.***\r\n**_As is this!_**\r\n*__And this!__*\r\n\r\nIn GitHub Flavored Markdown, which is used to render markdown files on GitHub, we also have strikethrough:\r\n\r\n~~This text is rendered with strikethrough.~~\r\n\r\nParagraphs\r\n\r\nParagraphs are a one or multiple adjacent lines of text separated by one or multiple blank lines.\r\n\r\nThis is a paragraph. I'm typing in a paragraph isn't this fun?\r\n\r\nNow I'm in paragraph 2.\r\nI'm still in paragraph 2 too!\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm in paragraph three!\r\n\r\nShould you ever want to insert an HTML <br /> tag, you can end a paragraph with two or more spaces and then begin a new paragraph.\r\n\r\nI end with two spaces (highlight me to see them).\r\n\r\nThere's a <br /> above me!\r\n\r\nBlock quotes are easy and done with the > character.\r\n\r\n> This is a block quote. You can either\r\n> manually wrap your lines and put a `>` before every line or you can let your lines get really long and wrap on their own.\r\n> It doesn't make a difference so long as they start with a `>`.\r\n\r\n> You can also use more than one level\r\n>> of indentation?\r\n> How neat is that?\r\n\r\nLists\r\n\r\nUnordered lists can be made using asterisks, pluses, or hyphens.\r\n\r\n* Item\r\n* Item\r\n* Another item\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n+ Item\r\n+ Item\r\n+ One more item\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n- Item\r\n- Item\r\n- One last item\r\n\r\nOrdered lists are done with a number followed by a period.\r\n\r\n1. Item one\r\n2. Item two\r\n3. Item three\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t even have to label the items correctly and Markdown will still render the numbers in order, but this may not be a good idea.\r\n\r\n1. Item one\r\n1. Item two\r\n1. Item three\r\n\r\n(This renders the same as the example above.)\r\n\r\nYou can also use sublists.\r\n\r\n1. Item one\r\n2. Item two\r\n3. Item three\r\n    * Sub-item\r\n    * Sub-item\r\n4. Item four\r\n\r\nThere are even task lists. This creates HTML checkboxes.\r\n\r\nBoxes below without the 'x' are unchecked HTML checkboxes.\r\n- [ ] First task to complete.\r\n- [ ] Second task that needs done\r\nThis checkbox below will be a checked HTML checkbox.\r\n- [x] This task has been completed\r\n\r\nCode blocks\r\n\r\nYou can indicate a code block (which uses the <code> element) by indenting a line with four spaces or a tab.\r\n\r\n    This is code\r\n    So is this\r\n\r\nYou can also re-tab (or add an additional four spaces) for indentation inside your code.\r\n\r\n    my_array.each do |item|\r\n      puts item\r\n    end\r\n\r\nInline code can be created using the backtick character `.\r\n\r\nJohn didn't even know what the `go_to()` function did!\r\n\r\nIn GitHub Flavored Markdown, you can use a special syntax for code.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef foobar\r\n  puts 'Hello world!'\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above text doesn\u2019t require indenting, plus GitHub will use syntax highlighting of the language you specify after the opening ```.\r\nHorizontal rule\r\n\r\nHorizontal rules (<hr/>) are easily added with three or more asterisks or hyphens, with or without spaces.\r\n\r\n***\r\n---\r\n- - -\r\n****************\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nOne of the best things about markdown is how easy it is to make links. Put the text to display in hard brackets [] followed by the url in parentheses ()\r\n\r\n[Click me!](http://test.com/)\r\n\r\nYou can also add a link title using quotes inside the parentheses.\r\n\r\n[Click me!](http://test.com/ 'Link to Test.com')\r\n\r\nRelative paths work too.\r\n\r\n[Go to music](/music/).\r\n\r\nMarkdown also supports reference style links.\r\n\r\n[Click this link][link1] for more info about it!\r\n[Also check out this link][foobar] if you want to.\r\n\r\n[link1]: http://test.com/ 'Cool!'\r\n[foobar]: http://foobar.biz/ 'Alright!'\r\n\r\nThe title can also be in single quotes or in parentheses, or omitted entirely. The references can be anywhere in your document and the reference IDs can be anything so long as they are unique.\r\n\r\nThere is also \u201cimplicit naming\u201d which lets you use the link text as the id.\r\n\r\n[This][] is a link.\r\n\r\n[This]: http://thisisalink.com/\r\n\r\nBut it\u2019s not that commonly used.\r\nTable of contents\r\n\r\nSome Markdown flavors even make use of the combination of lists, links and headings in order to create tables of contents. In this case, heading titles in lowercase are prepended with hash (#) and are used as link ids. Should the heading have multiple words, they will be connected with a hyphen (-), that also replaces some special characters. (Some other special characters are omitted though.)\r\n\r\n- [Heading](#heading)\r\n- [Another heading](#another-heading)\r\n- [Chapter](#chapter)\r\n  - [Subchapter <h3 />](#subchapter-h3-)\r\n\r\nNonetheless, this is a feature that might not be working in all Markdown implementations the same way.\r\nImages\r\n\r\nImages are done the same way as links but with an exclamation point in front!\r\n\r\n![This is the alt-attribute for my image](http://imgur.com/myimage.jpg 'An optional title')\r\n\r\nAnd reference style works as expected.\r\n\r\n![This is the alt-attribute.][myimage]\r\n\r\n[myimage]: relative/urls/cool/image.jpg 'if you need a title, it's here'\r\n\r\nMiscellany\r\nAuto-links\r\n\r\n<http://testwebsite.com/> is equivalent to\r\n[http://testwebsite.com/](http://testwebsite.com/)\r\n\r\nAuto-links for emails\r\n\r\n<foo@bar.com>\r\n\r\nEscaping characters\r\n\r\nI want to type *this text surrounded by asterisks* but I don't want it to be\r\nin italics, so I do this: \\*this text surrounded by asterisks\\*.\r\n\r\nKeyboard keys\r\n\r\nIn GitHub Flavored Markdown, you can use a <kbd> tag to represent keyboard keys.\r\n\r\nYour computer crashed? Try sending a\r\n<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd>\r\n\r\nTables\r\n\r\nTables are only available in GitHub Flavored Markdown and are slightly cumbersome, but if you really want it:\r\n\r\n| Col1         | Col2     | Col3          |\r\n| :----------- | :------: | ------------: |\r\n| Left-aligned | Centered | Right-aligned |\r\n| blah         | blah     | blah          |\r\n\r\nor, for the same results\r\n\r\nCol 1 | Col2 | Col3\r\n:-- | :-: | --:\r\nUgh this is so ugly | make it | stop\r\n\r\nMarkdownlint\r\n\r\nIn order to simplify work with Markdown and to unify its coding style, Markdownlint has been created. Available as a separate tool as well as a plugin for some IDEs, it can be used to ensure validity and readability of Markdown.\r\nFurther reading\r\n\r\nFor more info, check out John Gruber\u2019s official post of syntax here and Adam Pritchard\u2019s great cheatsheet here.\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more on some major Markdown flavors\u2019 features, see:\r\n\r\n    GitHub Flavored Markdown\r\n    GitLab Flavored Markdown\r\n\r\n\r\n\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1730887666, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180890187?s=400&u=91b73661f9c8346c1b8bab4e034895a9e6f27f13&v=4", "createdDate": "2024-11-06", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P6": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/have a good one.html", "labels": ["new"], "postTitle": "have a good one", "postUrl": "post/have%20a%20good%20one.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/isharebox/isharebox.github.io/issues/6", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 115, "description": "![aiimg](https://zaiwen.superatmas.com/images/09c69d855aa542b74f5ab4cfcafd65f33ce3632c1e70a01bcb738bb44c9d1832.png)\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1730889075, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180890187?s=400&u=91b73661f9c8346c1b8bab4e034895a9e6f27f13&v=4", "createdDate": "2024-11-06", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P7": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/backup, ouch, backup.html", "labels": ["bug"], "postTitle": "backup, ouch, backup", "postUrl": "post/backup%2C%20ouch%2C%20backup.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/isharebox/isharebox.github.io/issues/7", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 14, "description": "crazy terrible\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1732085942, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180890187?s=400&u=91b73661f9c8346c1b8bab4e034895a9e6f27f13&v=4", "createdDate": "2024-11-20", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P8": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/learn coze, use coze.html", "labels": ["documentation"], "postTitle": "learn coze, use coze", "postUrl": "post/learn%20coze%2C%20use%20coze.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/isharebox/isharebox.github.io/issues/8", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 55, "description": "time to use ai for everyone without computer background\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1733023168, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180890187?s=400&u=91b73661f9c8346c1b8bab4e034895a9e6f27f13&v=4", "createdDate": "2024-12-01", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}, "P10": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/quan-fei-shui-sheng-zhong-\uff0c-tao-hua-dai-lu-nong-\u3002.html", "labels": ["poem"], "postTitle": "\u72ac\u5420\u6c34\u58f0\u4e2d\uff0c\u6843\u82b1\u5e26\u9732\u6d53\u3002", "postUrl": "post/quan-fei-shui-sheng-zhong-%EF%BC%8C-tao-hua-dai-lu-nong-%E3%80%82.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/isharebox/isharebox.github.io/issues/10", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 162, "description": "\ud83c\udf19\u201c\u72ac\u5420\u6c34\u58f0\u4e2d\uff0c\u6843\u82b1\u5e26\u9732\u6d53\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1733410342, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180890187?s=400&u=91b73661f9c8346c1b8bab4e034895a9e6f27f13&v=4", "createdDate": "2024-12-05", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}}, "singeListJson": {}, "labelColorDict": {"book": "#7468E7", "bug": "#d73a4a", "cycling": "#73E199", "documentation": "#0075ca", "duplicate": "#cfd3d7", "enhancement": "#a2eeef", "good first issue": "#7057ff", "help wanted": "#008672", "invalid": "#e4e669", "music": "#FD91A1", "new": "#d93f0b", "off-grid": "#4354C4", "poem": "#657A72", "question": "#d876e3", "trading": "#258358", "wontfix": "#ffffff"}, "displayTitle": "Slowlylight", "faviconUrl": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180890187?s=400&u=91b73661f9c8346c1b8bab4e034895a9e6f27f13&v=4", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180890187?s=400&u=91b73661f9c8346c1b8bab4e034895a9e6f27f13&v=4", "primerCSS": "<link href='https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/cdnjs/ajax/libs/Primer/21.0.7/primer.css' rel='stylesheet' />", "homeUrl": "https://isharebox.github.io", "prevUrl": "disabled", "nextUrl": "disabled"}
